  Introduction:
 If a semi passes the parent rule, it will continue to be tested under each child rule. 
Each rule has actions which will be automatically invoked by the parser when the rule testing returns true. 
For example, the rules for detecting class, functions, etc. are all children of rules of detecting scopes.
So if a semi is tested to be the beginning of a scope, parser will continue to see if it is class scope or function scope.
The rules of detecting declaration statement, break statement are all children of detecting general statement.
So if a semi is tested to be a statement, parser will continue to determine what statement the semi is.
if a semi does not pass the rule, parser will move to its another sibling rule without going down to its child rules.
